/**
 * Fires a single compound event for each group of individual upstream events

 *
 * @param delayMs how long the throttled event should wait before firing.
 *
 * @param groupBy maps an upstream event to an event group.
 * If multiple upstream events share a group and occur within the given
 * time window, they will trigger a single compound event. The compound event
 * will fire after the time window has elapsed.
 *
 * @returns a function that transforms a fine-grained VS Code event source
 * to a coarser, throttled event source, so that a single compound event fires
 * at most every `delayMs` milliseconds for each event group.
 *
 * @type T Original payload type of the upstream event.
 *
 * @type U Output payload type, which will be passed as a parameter to the
 *         compound event when it fires.
 *         Instances of U may not have internal state, and they cannot be
 *         mutable.
