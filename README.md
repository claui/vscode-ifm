# vscode-ifm

This is the source code repository for the `ifm`
VS Code extension.

This document is for **contributors,** not for users of this
extension.  
For **user documentation,** see: [extension/README.md](./extension/README.md)  
For **license information,** see the bottom of this document.

## About the extension

For a list of features and details, see the user documentation:
[extension/README.md](./extension/README.md)

## Requirements for contributing

Working on this VS Code extension requires the following programs to
be installed on your system:

- `yarn` (required)
- `nvm` (recommended)

## Preparing your session

To prepare your session, `cd` to the project root directory, then
run `nvm use`.

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies, run: `yarn install`

If that fails, consult the _Maintenance_ section.

## Building the extension

To build the extension, run: `yarn package`

Unlike `vsce package`, running `yarn package` will work around issue
[microsoft/vscode-vsce#517](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/517).
Use `yarn package` as long as the issue is unresolved.

## Publishing the extension

Publishing the extension has several steps:

1. Merge the contributions.
2. Choose a target version number.
3. Publish to the Marketplace. (This modifies `extension/package.json`.)
4. Publish to the Open VSX Registry.
5. Create a Git commit, Git tag, GitHub prerelease and GitHub PR.

### Merging the contributions

Make sure that all the contributions you’re going to have in the
release have been merged to the `main` branch.

### Choosing a target version number

With all contributions merged into `main`, choose a target version
number.  
[The VS Code folks recommend](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions)
the following numbering scheme:

- `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` (e.g. 1.1.0) for **pre-release** versions; and
- `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` (e.g. 1.2.0) for **release** versions.

### Publishing to the Marketplace

After deciding on a target version, run:

- `git checkout main`
- `yarn login`
- `yarn publish-vsce [--pre-release] [version]`

The `yarn publish-vsce` command first updates the version number in
[extension/package.json](./extension/package.json) to the given
version. Then it packages and publishes the extension to the VS Code
Extension Marketplace.

### Publishing to the Open VSX Registry

Follow these steps to publish the extension to the Open VSX Registry:

1. Set the `OVSX_PAT` environment variable to your personal access
   token.

   For example, if you’re on Bash and you have your token in
   1Password, you could run the following command line:

   ```bash
   read -r OVSX_PAT < <(
     op item get 'Open VSX Registry' --fields password
   ) && export OVSX_PAT
   ```

2. Make sure you have published the extension to the VS Code
   Extension Marketplace. This ensures that the version number has
   been updated and that a `.vsix` file has been generated.

3. Run the `yarn ovsx publish` command with the correct
   `extension/[…].vsix` file as the sole argument. Example in Bash:

   ```bash
   yarn ovsx publish "extension/ifm-$(jq -r .version extension/package.json).vsix"
   ```

### Committing, tagging and creating a GitHub prerelease and PR

With the extension now published on the Marketplace, commit the
change, create a tag, push, cut a GitHub (pre-)release, and create a
pull request against `main`:

```
(
  set -eux
  git checkout -b publish
  tag="$(jq -r '"v" + .version' extension/package.json)"
  echo "New tag: ${tag}"
  git add -u
  git commit --edit -m "Release ${tag}"
  git tag "${tag}"
  git push --tags
  gh release create --generate-notes --prerelease "${tag}"
  gh pr create --fill --web
)
```

## Maintenance

### yarn install

To install the current project dependencies as specified in
`package.json` and `yarn.lock`, run `yarn install`.

### yarn clean-install

If the Yarn version has changed and you run `yarn install`, Yarn
will try to upgrade itself. That causes changes to several files,
such as the `LICENSE` files I have placed into several
subdirectories.

Anytime that happens, run the `yarn clean-install` script, a wrapper
around `yarn install` which cleans up afterwards.

Note that the `yarn clean-install` script may fail and tell you to
run `yarn install` instead. I haven’t figured out why it does that.
If that happens, run `yarn install` followed by `yarn clean-install`.

### yarn outdated

To see a list of outdated packages, run: `yarn outdated`

### yarn upgrade-lockfile

This runs `yarn up -R '**' && yarn clean-install` behind the scenes
in order to upgrade all resolutions in the lockfile as far as
possible, but leaves your `package.json` as is.

### yarn upgrade-packages

The built-in `yarn up` command can be a bit cumbersome to use if you
want to upgrade all dependencies in one go.

Running the `yarn upgrade-packages` script will upgrade all relevant
dependencies. That includes the `@types`, `@typescript-eslint`, and
`@yarnpkg` scopes but excludes Yarn itself (see the
`yarn upgrade-yarn-itself` section).

Also excluded is the `@types/vscode` package. For details, see
section _Upgrading the VS Code API_.

### yarn upgrade-yarn-itself

To upgrade Yarn PnP to the latest available version, run the
`yarn upgrade-yarn-itself` script.

Note that the script will only print manual instructions. That’s
because Yarn makes changes to `package.json`, and that doesn’t play
well with Yarn PnP in scripts.

### yarn upgrade-all

To also upgrade Yarn itself, run `yarn upgrade-all`.

### Upgrading the VS Code API version

Upgrading the version of the `@types/vscode` package should always
be a manual step and a conscious decision. It effectively bumps the
minimum supported VS Code version that this extension supports.

To bump the minimum supported VS Code version, follow these steps:

1. In `package.json`, manually update the minimum version to a new
   version tuple (e.g. `=1.99`).  
   Make sure to preserve the `=` prefix as you change the value.

2. In `package.json`, modify the `upgrade-package` script to update
   the same tuple (e.g `@types/vscode@=1.99`).  
   Preserve the `@types/vscode@=` prefix as you change the value.

3. In `extension/package.json` under the `engines` section, manually
   update the value of the `vscode` property to the chosen version.
   Since `vsce` expects a triple for that property, append a `.0`.  
   Preserve the `^` prefix as you change the value.

4. Run `yarn clean-install`.

## Patching dependencies

Sometimes you may want to tweak a dependency. This section explains how to do that using `yarn patch`.

### Start editing

To start editing a dependency, run `yarn patch <dependency>`.

For example, to start editing the `vsce` executable, run:

```shell
yarn patch @vscode/vsce@npm:2.18.0
```

Since this project is already patching this dependency, you may want to apply the existing patch to the temporary working directory:

```shell
patch < path/to/this/project/.yarn/patches/@vscode-vsce-npm-2.18.0-c171711221.patch
```

### Committing a patch for the first time

To commit a patch for the first time, run `yarn patch-commit -s <workdir>`.

### Modifying an existing patch

To commit a modified patch, run `yarn repatch -- <workdir>`.

For example, if the temporary working directory is `/tmp/xfs-36e26fe6/user`, run:

```shell
yarn repatch -- /tmp/xfs-36e26fe6/user
```

Note: `yarn repatch` is a custom script. It serves to work around two issues in `yarn patch-commit`:

- Using bare `yarn patch-commit` would create a nested patch while amending the patch is what I actually want.

- It may also use an incorrect key in the resolution entry it writes to `package.json`.  
  The key should match the dependency’s semver expression, not the resolved version.
  Using the latter as a key causes the resolution to never apply.  
  Example for a correct key: `"@vscode/vsce@^2.18.0"`

## Handling vulnerable dependencies

### The thing about vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies

People sometimes discover vulnerabilities in packages on which
vscode-ifm depends.

If that happens and a patch comes out, I need to upgrade the
affected package to a newer version, which includes the patch.

But a vulnerability might also affect a package on which
vscode-ifm depends only indirectly, e.g. through a
transitive requirement. A patch may exist for such a package, but
somewhere in the chain of dependencies (from the vulnerable package
all the way down to vscode-ifm), the patch may be
outside the specified semver range so I **can’t upgrade** the
package via the usual `yarn up` or `yarn up -R` command.

### Dealing with the risk

If such cases arise, I’m going to try force-upgrading affected
packages, and document those upgrades in the section
_List of force-upgraded transitive dependencies_ below.  
Even if the upgrade happens to fail (or if it breaks the app and I
have to roll back the upgrade, leaving the vulnerability unpatched),
I’m also going to document that failure here.

## List of force-upgraded transitive dependencies

The goal of this list is:

- to document the drift between version requirements (in the tree
  of `package.json` files) and the resolutions in `yarn.lock`; and

- to inform about unpatched vulnerabilities.

<!-- Remove this line when adding the first entry: -->No entries yet.

<!--
I have preserved the order in which I have applied the upgrades.
The list starts with the first upgrade and ends with the latest one.
-->

<!--
### Vulnerability in …………, dependency of ………… v…………

I have manually bumped `…………`’s dependency `…………` to
v………… in order to bump the transitive dependency `…………` to v…………:

```shell
yarn set resolution --save …………@npm:………… …………
```

(Remove this section once an upgrade to `…………` is available
that depends on ………… v………… or higher.)
